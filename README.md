# Random Design of Microfluidics

This site provides supplementary material to accompany the paper ["Random Design of Microfluidics" by Junchao Wang, Philip Brisk, and William H. Grover, *Lab on a Chip* **16**, 4212-4219 (2016)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/lc/c6lc00758a) [(PDF)](https://groverlab.org/assets/random-microfluidics.pdf).

The file `[random.csv](random.csv)` contains the results from all 10513 random chip designs that were generated and simulated in the above paper.  This is a text file in [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).  Each line in the file corresponds to one random chip design, and commas are used to separate values on each line.
